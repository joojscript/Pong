# JavaPong

![JavaPong](https://github.com/joojscript/Pong/blob/master/.github/javapong.gif?raw=true)

Just a simple version of the golden classic! I made this in Java while first started learning the language.

### How to play it?

With Java already installed (JRE or JDK), clone the repo, compile, and run the Game.java file.
I higly recommend using Eclipse IDE to run this.
